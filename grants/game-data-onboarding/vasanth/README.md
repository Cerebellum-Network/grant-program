# Game Voice Chat Audio Onboarding
## Proposal submitted to Cere Foundation on Nov 14 2025 by Vasanth Pugalenthi


## Abstract
This proposal focuses on game session data and pushing it into an existing workspace, ensuring the existing workflow can process audio by converting it to text. The game data is simply onboarded using the Client SDK.


The system will:
- Record voice through a microphone
- Capture game data through a game API
- Transcribe voice audio before passing it into a stream using the Client SDK
- Simulate live game sessions or replay via controlled input datasets using the testing framework (A6), which is already integrated with the Client SDK (A1)
- Leverage the existing Query Tool to extract results of generated by the existing workspace that does NLP Processing and stores outputs in a Cubbie

| Number | Deliverable | Specification |
| -----: | ----------- | ------------- |
| 1 | Game Session Recording System | A simple UI that records voice through a microphone and game data using an API during live Marvel Rival game sessions. It captures audio input and transcribes it using Whisper and stores game data in json format. |
| 2 | Testing Framework Integration | Simulate live game sessions or replay using the testing framework (A6), which is already integrated with the Client SDK (A1). |
| 3 | Query Tool Integration | Leverage the existing Query Tool to extract results stored in a cubbie. Provides access to processed data for verification and testing. |
| 4 | Documentation | Basic documentation covering: how to run the system, required configurations, and credentials needed. Includes setup instructions and usage examples. |
