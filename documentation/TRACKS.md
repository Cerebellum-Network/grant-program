# Contributor Tracks

The Cere Contributor Program targets technology-oriented projects of protocol layer and applications that serve a wide range of users. The program provides guidelines for various areas such as runtime modules/chains, development tools, UI development, backend development, cryptography, research, and documentation. 

Cere is currently accepting Proposals for Grants, Hackathons and other such development activities that cover all all areas of the Cere Stack, including innovations in Web2 Application integrations, bleeding edge, on-chain Dapps and Smart Contract systems, development and testing tools, optimizations, and other ideas that are important for the Cere Network and the Decentralized Data Cloud ecosystem.
