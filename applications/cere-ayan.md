# Developer Console USDC / Fiat Onboarding Proposal  
## Proposal submitted to Cere Foundation on Wednesday, April 24, 2025, by Ayan Choradia

---

## Project Slug  
_Custom implementation based on Cere's Developer Console requirements and funding initiative._

---

## Abstract  
The decentralized landscape is still intimidating for the average user. Converting fiat to tokens, handling wallets, managing gas fees, and funding on-chain accounts introduce complexity, friction, and drop-offs. To bring the next wave of developers and businesses to the Cere ecosystem, this proposal introduces a **Unified Developer Console Top-up Gateway**—a seamless fiat and crypto onboarding solution integrated directly into the Cere Developer Console.

### 🌉 Unified Vision: One Gateway to Onboard Them All

We propose an end-to-end system that allows users to top up their Cere Developer Console (DDC) accounts using fiat (via Stripe) or stablecoins like USDC/USDT. Funds are automatically swapped into CERE tokens using an on-chain fund management contract, and the user’s DDC balance is updated on-chain using automated Substrate hooks. This eliminates the need for users to understand token swaps or bridge mechanics.

This is not just a set of integrations—it’s an intelligent pipeline with automated fund routing, error handling, and account updating, making Cere as easy to onboard as a traditional SaaS platform.

### Why This Matters  
- **Frictionless UX** for developers, startups, and enterprise users.  
- **Faster onboarding** into Cere’s data infrastructure (DDC).  
- **Modular architecture** that can be reused for other Cere products or partner tools.  
- **Cross-chain readiness**, supporting users from multiple chains and geographies.

## Future Plans  
- Package and open-source reusable components (`@cere/onramp`, `@cere/substrate-funder`, etc.)  
- Add additional fiat providers (e.g., Transak, Ramp, Apple Pay)  
- Create a Cere-specific `fiatTopUp()` SDK for dApps using DDC  
- Launch interactive documentation and in-console tutorials  
- Run onboarding hackathons to boost dev adoption

## Other Bio and Details  
I’m deeply committed to creating onboarding flows that match Web2 simplicity while preserving Web3 sovereignty. Cere’s ecosystem has the infrastructure—this proposal adds the "invisible glue" that connects end users with it smoothly. Let’s build the bridge from intention to action.
