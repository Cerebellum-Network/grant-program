## Abstract

This project delivers a robust DDC account top-up system for Cere Network, enabling users to fund their accounts using stablecoins (USDC/USDT) and fiat payments via Stripe. The solution abstracts token swaps and cross-chain transfers through a multi-layered architecture of smart contracts and backend services. Key components include a StablecoinPaymentHandler contract for secure token management, TokenSwapper for automated USDC/USDT to CERE conversion via Uniswap V3, HyperbridgeTeleport for cross-chain transfers, and a backend with full payment lifecycle management. The implementation adheres to security best practices, includes error handling with retry mechanisms, and optimizes gas costs.

### Team's experience

As a Full Stack developer specialized in blockchain, I bring expertise in:

- Building decentralized applications (dApps) with React, TypeScript, and Web3.js/ethers.js
- Writing Solidity smart contracts for DeFi protocols
- Integrating Stripe with blockchain solutions
- Developing interchain teleportation systems and token swaps
- High Efficency of work in terms of building.

For this project, I’d be using my powerful AI Agent Zyxel, who will help me while building the next 2 milestones: Smart Contrats and Backend. (And you would just need a SOLO team)

## Development Roadmap :nut_and_bolt:

### Overview

- **Total Estimated Duration:** From 1 week up to 2 weeks. Daily updated.
- 
### Milestone 1 — Base Architecture and Smart Contracts

- **Estimated Duration:** 50% of total work.


| Number | Deliverable | Specification |
| -----: | ----------- | ------------- |
| 1 | Design Document | Detailed system architecture document with flow diagrams covering the full payment process, contract specifications, API endpoints, and database schemas. |
| 2 | Smart Contracts | Implementation of `StablecoinPaymentHandler` (handles payment receipt and validation), `TokenSwapper` (interfaces with Uniswap V3 for USDC/USDT to CERE conversion), and `HyperbridgeTeleport` (manages cross-chain transfers). Developed in Solidity with rigorous security checks. |
| 3 | Tests | Comprehensive unit and integration tests for all contracts, achieving >90% coverage. Includes edge cases, failure modes, and attack vectors. Built with Hardhat and Waffle. |
| 4 | Documentation | Full technical documentation with function specs, integration guides, security notes, and deployment steps. Includes inline code comments and a separate technical spec document. |

### Milestone 2 — Backend Services and Integration

- **Estimated Duration:** 50% of total time


| Number | Deliverable | Specification |
| -----: | ----------- | ------------- |
| 1 | Backend Services | Implementation of core services: `PaymentService` (manages payment lifecycle), `ContractService` (interacts with smart contracts), `StripeService` (processes fiat payments), `TeleportService` (handles cross-chain ops), and `DDCService` (updates DDC API). Built with TypeScript and Node.js. |
| 2 | API | RESTful endpoints for payment initiation, status checks, and DDC balance verification. Features authentication, rate limiting, and input validation. Documented via Swagger. |
| 3 | Stripe Integration | Full Stripe integration for fiat payments, including webhook handling, client-side Elements, and reconciliation for failed payments. |
| 4 | Uniswap Integration | Service for automatic USDC/USDT to CERE swaps via Uniswap V3, with slippage protection and gas optimization. |
| 5 | Tests | Unit and integration tests for all services with mocked dependencies. Includes end-to-end testing of the payment flow. |

## My offer ##

I'm asking 2000€ for this PR and will also include a frontend template/draft for free so you can guys have a guideline regarding this.

## Other Bio and details or thoughts

The DDC Top-Up system enhances Cere Network’s usability by simplifying complex blockchain operations. While I built the initial prototype in 6 hours, this proposal reflects a realistic timeline and team size for a production-ready implementation.
