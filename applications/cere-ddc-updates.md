-   [Automated DDC Account Update (Substrate)](https://dorahacks.io/hackathon/bounty/1152)

## Abstract

The team intends to work on the bounties linked above. Our deliverables will include a smart contract along with an updated version of the developer console featuring the following:

-   Automated updates
-   Ability to connect to an EOA wallet to interact with the contract, which will swap any token to CERE and bridge them to the CERE mainnet

## Development Roadmap üî©

### Overview

There‚Äôs not much to explain in the roadmap, as we will be following the provided specifications. It will take us 8 days to develop a working and well-tested smart contract deployed to mainnet. The remaining time will be spent implementing automatic DDC updates.

For the first bounty (swap smart contract), the following features will be included:

-   On the DDC, users can connect a wallet (any EOA)
-   After the user sends ETH/ERC-20 tokens to the contract:
    -   The contract swaps the given token to CERE
    -   Then bridges those tokens to the CERE mainnet using Hyperbridge

Regarding the DDC, I will add more details soon‚ÄîI haven‚Äôt reviewed it yet. The current focus has been on understanding Hyperbridge and the token-bridging process.

### Milestone 1 ‚Äî Smart Contract Functionality

-   **Estimated Duration:** 10 days
-   **FTE:** 1

| Number | Deliverable    | Specification                                                                 |
| ------ | -------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1      | Smart Contract | The smart contract can swap any token to CERE and bridge it using Hyperbridge |

### Milestone 2 ‚Äî DDC Automated Account Update

-   **Estimated Duration:** 10 days
-   **FTE:** 1

| Number | Deliverable           | Specification                                                                       |
| ------ | --------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1      | DDC Automatic Updates | Haven‚Äôt had a chance to finalize the details yet, but an outline will be ready soon |

## Future Plans

Please include here:

-   How you intend to finance the project's long-term maintenance and development
-   How you intend to use, enhance, and promote your project in the short term
-   The team‚Äôs long-term plans and intentions regarding the project

## Preferred Method of Fund Delivery

-   USD/EUR fiat (preferred via PayPal or another method the team supports; USDC is also acceptable but fiat is preferred)
-   USDC on Ethereum address: `0x0645AFbfE8e09ECF48B85f583F73978f176dC27C`

## Other Bio, Details, or Thoughts

Regarding the smart contract, I‚Äôm fairly confident the team isn‚Äôt expecting an audit. However, if one is conducted, we‚Äôre open to implementing the suggested changes.

There is one remaining bounty I can pick up as well. However, I‚Äôd like to discuss the ideal flow first, which is why it hasn‚Äôt been included here. If the team is okay with us handling the entire scope, we can do that after discussion. In that case, the timeline would increase by around 10 days.
