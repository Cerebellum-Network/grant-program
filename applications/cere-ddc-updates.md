## Abstract

The team intends to work on the bounties linked above. Our deliverables will include a smart contract along with an updated version of the developer console featuring the following:

-   Automated updates
-   Ability to connect to an EOA wallet to interact with the contract, which will swap any token to CERE and bridge them to the CERE mainnet

## Development Roadmap üî©

### Overview

There‚Äôs not much to explain in the roadmap, as we will be following the provided specifications. It will take us 8 days to develop a working and well-tested smart contract deployed to mainnet. The remaining time will be spent implementing automatic DDC updates.

For the first bounty (swap smart contract), the following features will be included:

-   On the DDC, users can connect a wallet (any EOA)
-   After the user sends ETH/ERC-20 tokens to the contract:
    -   The contract swaps the given token to CERE
    -   Then bridges those tokens to the CERE mainnet using Hyperbridge

Regarding the DDC, I will add more details soon‚ÄîI haven‚Äôt reviewed it yet. The current focus has been on understanding Hyperbridge and the token-bridging process.

### Milestone 1 ‚Äî Smart Contract Functionality

-   **Estimated Duration:** 10 days
-   **FTE:** 1

| Number | Deliverable    | Specification                                                                 |
| ------ | -------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1      | Smart Contract | The smart contract can swap any token to CERE and bridge it using Hyperbridge |

### Milestone 2 ‚Äî DDC Automated Account Update

-   **Estimated Duration:** 10 days
-   **FTE:** 1

| Number | Deliverable           | Specification                                                                       |
| ------ | --------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1      | DDC Automatic Updates | Haven‚Äôt had a chance to finalize the details yet, but an outline will be ready soon |

## Future Plans

The current future plans are limited to updating the smart contract if the team decides to conduct an audit. If the team proceeds with an audit through an auditing firm, we can update the contracts based on the audit report. Additionally, if the team wants further updates to the developer console, we‚Äôre open to discussing that; assuming the submitted work for the bounty is satisfactory.


## Preferred Method of Fund Delivery

-   USD/EUR fiat (preferred via PayPal or another method the team supports; USDC is also acceptable but fiat is preferred)
-   USDC on Ethereum address: `0x0645AFbfE8e09ECF48B85f583F73978f176dC27C`

## Other Bio, Details, or Thoughts

Regarding the smart contract, I‚Äôm fairly confident the team isn‚Äôt expecting an audit. Still, I‚Äôd like to confirm, please let us know in the PR comments.

There is one remaining bounty I can take on as well. However, I‚Äôd like to first discuss the flow, which is why it hasn‚Äôt been included here. If the team is okay with us handling all three bounties, we‚Äôre happy to do so after discussing the flow. In that case, the timeline would increase by approximately 10 days.

Also, I wanted to check if it would be possible to receive the full $2,000 budget if we decide to take on all three bounties. Please let me know about that as well in the PR comments.
