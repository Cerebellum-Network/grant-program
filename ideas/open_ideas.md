#### Developer Console USDC / Fiat Onboarding
**Objective:**  
The primary goal of this initiative is to enhance the **Developer Console UI** by enabling users to directly top up their **DDC wallets** using fiat currencies (e.g., USD) or cryptocurrencies like **USDC/USDT** on EVM-based networks. This feature aims to:
- Streamline the onboarding process for developers.
- Reduce reliance on external services for acquiring CERE tokens.
