## üìù Introduction

The current manual top-up process for DDC accounts is inefficient, requiring multiple steps and creating risks of service interruptions due to delays. This project aims to **automate and simplify the process** using fiat currencies, stablecoins (USDC/USDT), and blockchain technology.

---

## üéØ Objective

The initiative has two primary goals:

1. **Enhance the Developer Console UI** to enable direct top-ups using USD (Fiat) or USDC/USDT on EVM-based networks.
2. **Extend the DDC Customer Pallet** with an automatic top-up mechanism on the Cere Mainnet using mandates.

| **Term**              | **Definition**                                                                 |
|------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **On-Ramp Provider**   | Service enabling fiat-to-crypto conversion.                                   |
| **Substrate**          | Framework for building blockchain systems.                                    |
| **Fiat**               | Government-issued currency like USD.                                         |
| **USDC/USDT**          | Stablecoins pegged to the value of USD.                                       |
| **Mandates**           | Automated instructions for recurring transactions.                            |

## ‚öôÔ∏è Existing System and Challenges
![../../images/image1.png](../../images/image1.png)
### Current System Workflow

1. **Creating a DDC Account:** Customers specify account ID and top-up amount, verified by the system.
2. **Topping Up Existing Accounts:** Users manually transfer funds from their wallets to on-chain accounts.
3. **Charging for Usage:** Usage charges are deducted from customer accounts and reflected in ledgers.

### Challenges ‚ùå
- Dependency on Cere tokens creates barriers for non-blockchain-savvy users.
- Manual top-ups increase risks of service interruptions due to low balances.

## üõ†Ô∏è Manually Top-Up DDC Account to understand current system (Exercise)

### Steps to Manually Top-Up

1. Sign up at the Developer Console using an email ID.

## üí° Proposed Solution

### Track 1: On-Ramp Provider & Smart Contract Integration üåâ
![../../images/image5.png](../../images/image5.png)
![../../images/image6.png](../../images/image6.png)

#### Objective
Enable direct top-ups using fiat (USD) or stablecoins (USDC/USDT), reducing manual effort and streamlining the user experience.

#### Quickstart Guide {WIP} üöÄ
Steps:
1. Set up a development environment with required tools (Node.js, Solidity compiler, etc.).
2. Integrate with an On-Ramp API (e.g., Ramp Network, Transak).
3. Deploy smart contracts for token swaps and teleportation.
4. Connect to Hyperbridge for token transfers between networks.
5. Update Developer Console UI for seamless user interaction.
6. Test the end-to-end process.

#### Tasks and Features
- Fiat-to-crypto conversion via On-Ramp providers.
- Automate token swaps and teleportation using smart contracts.
- Enhance UI/UX with updated Developer Console features.

#### Milestones ‚è≥
1. Research & Setup: Finalize On-Ramp provider selection and develop prototypes.
2. Development: Implement fiat-to-USDT/USDC conversion and smart contracts.
3. Integration & Testing: Connect with Hyperbridge and test end-to-end functionality.
4. Deployment: Update UI and launch in production.

#### Deliverables ‚úÖ
1. A manual process enabling users to top up their accounts with fiat or crypto through an intuitive interface.
2. Programmatic automation of swaps, teleportation, and account updates via smart contracts integrated with Hyperbridge.
3. A polished UI/UX in the Developer Console that allows seamless fiat or crypto top-ups with minimal friction.
4. Documentation outlining the integration steps, workflows, and APIs used in this Track.

### Track 2: Substrate-Based Enhancements (WIP)
![../../images/image7.png](../../images/image7.png)
#### Objective
Develop an automated system for recurring top-ups based on mandates, ensuring uninterrupted service delivery.

#### Quickstart Guide {WIP} üöÄ
Steps:
1. Set up a development environment with required tools (Node.js, Solidity compiler, etc.).
2. Integrate with an On-Ramp API (e.g., Ramp Network, Transak).
3. Deploy smart contracts for token swaps and teleportation.
4. Connect to Hyperbridge for token transfers between networks.
5. Update Developer Console UI for seamless user interaction.
6. Test the end-to-end process.

#### Tasks üìã
1. Allow users to set up mandates via Cere Wallet.
2. Monitor account balances for low-level detection.
3. Automate top-ups upon low balance detection.

#### Deliverables {WIP}
- Enhanced DDC Customer Pallet supporting mandates.
- Updated Developer Console UI linked with Cere Wallet.
