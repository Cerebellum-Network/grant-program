# RFP: AI Agent Challenge ‚Äì Open Developer Track

## Summary

We invite proposals for the development and deployment of a **multi-agent system** that ingests raw customer service voice data, processes it into structured insights, and performs real-time sentiment and trigger analysis. The system will demonstrate the orchestration of multiple AI agents (via Raft, EventRelay, and compatible frameworks) collaborating to produce structured, actionable intelligence from call center recordings.

---

## Scope of Work 

The primary objective is to **deploy multi-agents within our system** to:  
1. Ingest WAV/MP3 call recordings.  
2. Accurately transcribe voice into structured, time-stamped text.  
3. Build a semantic context tree highlighting key aspects of each conversation.  
4. Perform time-series sentiment analysis and identify triggers for major emotional shifts.  
5. Aggregate outputs into a report that can be rendered in a **test UI page** for review.

---
## Suggested Multi-Agent Functionality

### Agent 1: Speech-to-Text Agent
- Functional transcription with timestamps.  

### Agent 2: Semantic Context Builder
- Context tree and conversation summaries.  
- Outputs ‚ÄúCustomer Issue / Agent Action / Resolution Status‚Äù consistently.  

### Agent 3: Sentiment & Trigger Analysis
- Sentiment time-series.  
- Detection of sharp emotional transitions with text trigger .  

### Agent 4: Agent Collaboration & UI Demo
- Integrated agent pipeline.  
- Test UI displaying structured report.

---

## Input Data

- **Voice Recordings**: WAV/MP3 format.  
- Data can be **synthesized test calls** or **existing anonymized test recordings**.  
- Agents should process streams and/or batch data consistently.

---

## Deliverables

- **Multi-agent pipeline implementation** (open-sourced under compatible license).  
- **Demo/test UI page** for visualization of results.  
- **Sample processed outputs** from provided recordings.  
- Documentation describing agent architecture & agent interactions.  

---

## Evaluation Criteria

- **Technical Completeness**: Robustness of agents, especially under noisy input.  
- **Accuracy**: Transcription, semantic extraction, and sentiment detection fidelity.  
- **Integration**: Ability of agents to share data via Raft/EventRelay.  
- **Usability**: Clarity of structured output and UI display.  
- **Extensibility**: Ease of adding future agents or adapting workflow.

## Quickstart Guide

### Step 1: Prerequisites

1. Apply for access: [Noteforms Application](https://noteforms.com/forms/bullish-image-challenge-ajxsbr)  
   ‚è± Please allow up to **48h** for confirmation.  
2. Upon approval, you‚Äôll receive:
   - Closed beta access to the Cere AI Stack
   - Access to a private Discord channel  
3. If you have issues, reach out to **Bren** on Telegram: [@nerbke](https://t.me/nerbke) or Discord: [@InvB](https://discord.gg/HtkRSgUCMB)

---

### Step 2: Deploy Your First Agent

#### 2.1 Choose Your Model

1. Navigate to [ROB Platform](https://rob.stage.cere.io/) 
2. Login via email  (use the e-mail you signed up with)
3. Go to **Model Registry**  
4. Select the model you want to use  
5. Click on **Quickstart**  
6. Copy the code & save it somewhere (e.g. in a text file)
7. Close **Model Registry**  

#### 2.2 Create Your Agent

1. Go to **Agent Registry**  
2. Click **Create Agent**  
3. Select **Programmable Agent**  
4. Configure details - make sure you follow this naming format: "BIC - your name - your agent name"
   ```
    name: "CSC - Alice - Call Sentiment Analyzer"
    description: "Multi-agent pipeline for speech-to-text, semantic context building, and sentiment analysis"

   ```
5. Skip tools setup 
6. Add task
7. Copy & paste the **Quickstart code** you copied earlier from the model registry
8. Review & submit your agent
9. IMPORTANT: ask the admin (eg Bren on Discord) to deploy your agent into the datastream

#### 2.3 Test Your Agent in Playground

1. Go to the Agent Registry
2. Filter on "own models"
3. Click on your model
4. Click on "Playground"
5. Run a first test

---

### Step 3: Concierge agent
Using the concierge agent you can trigger your agent(s) based on the Telegram data stream coming in through your bot.

1. Go to your organisation dashboard in ROB
2. Click on "Engagements"
3. Click & edit the "AI Image Agent challenge Engagement" that was prepared for you (if you don't see this, ask Bren on Discord ot make it)
4. Click on the "CONCIERGE AGENT" tab
5. Look for "// CHANGE THIS CODE TO YOUR BOT; in this example we use the faceSwapAgent" and replace the code with your agent(s)
6. Go to your Telegram channel and type "/fun" to invoke your agent flow

---

### Step 4: Deploy Your Own Model

#### 4.1 Package a Model

Example using HuggingFace MobileNetV2:

```bash
brew install git-lfs
git lfs install
git clone https://huggingface.co/google/mobilenet_v2_1.0_224
cd mobilenet_v2_1.0_224
zip -r ../mobilenet_v2_cv.zip .
cd ..
```

üí° **Note:** Most HuggingFace models should be supported by Model Runtime. If a model doesn‚Äôt work, let us know and we‚Äôll extend runtime support.

Result: you now have `mobilenet_v2_cv.zip` (~14MB) ready for upload.

#### 4.2 Upload Model to DDC

1. Go to: [Cere Developer Console](https://stage.developer.console.cere.network/)  
2. Sign up with your e-mail  
3. Go to **Account**  
4. Click **Top Up**  
5. Copy your **Cere Wallet Address**  
6. Request tokens in Discord and tag **@InvB** (provide your public address)  
7. Once received, use 40 tokens to top up your account  
8. Confirm  
9. Go to **Content Storage** ‚Üí **Create New Bucket**  
10. Click **Upload File** (upload your model archive)  

After upload, you‚Äôll get a model link like:

```text
https://cdn.ddc-dragon.com/1317/baear4ibdfxtw6zvhlbr37i4sobqvo4qheiee37hwj2gtnuvgwzi5aol
fte/mobilenet_v2_cv.zip
```

This link contains:

- **Bucket ID**: `1317`  
- **Path**: `baear4ibdfxtw6zvhlbr37i4sobqvo4qheiee37hwj2gtnuvgwzi5aolfte/mobilenet_v2_cv.zip`  

Keep these values ‚Äî you‚Äôll need them for inference.

#### 4.3 Run Your First Inference

Example inference request:

```bash
curl -X POST --location 'http://202.181.153.253:8000/inference' -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{
  "model": {
    "bucket": "1317",
    "path": "baear4ibdfxtw6zvhlbr37i4sobqvo4qheiee37hwj2gtnuvgwzi5aolfte/mobilenet_v2_cv.zip"
  },
  "input": {
    "type": "image",
    "link": "https://cdn.ddc-dragon.com/1317/.../dog.jpeg"
  },
  "options": {
    "model_type": "huggingface",
    "top_k": 3,
    "min_confidence": 0.0001
  }
}'
```

Expected response:

```json
{
  "output": [
    { "label": "golden retriever", "score": 0.77 },
    { "label": "Leonberg", "score": 0.06 },
    { "label": "Tibetan mastiff", "score": 0.02 }
  ],
  "metrics": {
    "inference_time": 0.0616
  }
}
```
