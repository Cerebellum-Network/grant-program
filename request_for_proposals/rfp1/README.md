**Objective:**  
The goal of this initiative is to improve the **Developer Console UI** by enabling users to directly top up their **DDC wallets** using fiat currencies (e.g., 💵 USD) or cryptocurrencies like **USDC/USDT** on EVM-based networks. This feature aims to:
- ✅ Simplify the onboarding process for developers.
- ✅ Reduce reliance on external services for acquiring CERE tokens.

**Budget:**
Up to 2.000 USDT
