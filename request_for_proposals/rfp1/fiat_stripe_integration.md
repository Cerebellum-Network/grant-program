# Proposal: Fiat-Based Top-Up for DDC Accounts (via Stripe)

## Abstract

This proposal enables users to top up their **Decentralized Data Cluster (DDC)** accounts using **fiat payments** through **Stripe** (credit/debit cards).  
Users will no longer need to manually acquire cryptocurrencies.  
The system will automatically convert fiat to **USDC**, swap **USDC to CERE**, and bridge CERE to the **Cere Mainnet** to credit DDC accounts.

## Proposed Solution 💡

Users will top up DDC accounts using fiat payments through **Stripe**.  
System flow:
- Stripe payment (fiat USD/EUR)
- Fiat to USDC conversion
- Swap USDC to CERE using decentralized exchanges (DEX)
- Bridge CERE to Cere Mainnet using Hyperbridge
- Credit user’s DDC account
