# DDC SDK Built-in Encryption for Secure Data Storage

## Proposal submitted to Cere Foundation on [30th May 2025] by Nitin Gupta


## Abstract
This proposal aims to implement built-in encryption capabilities for Cere's Decentralized Data Cluster (DDC) SDK, enabling automatic client-side encryption during uploads and decryption during downloads. Currently, developers must implement encryption manually, which is error-prone and non-uniform. This project will embed encryption directly into the DDC SDK core, Playground, and CLI, making "privacy by default" a seamless part of every data flow. The solution will include a Cipher interface, AES-GCM encryption implementation, UI controls for the Playground, and command-line flags for the CLI.

## Development Roadmap :nut_and_bolt:

### Overview
- **Total Estimated Duration:** 3-4 weeks
- **Full-Time Equivalent (FTE):** 1.0

### Milestone 1 — Core SDK Encryption Implementation
- **Estimated Duration:** 2 weeks
- **FTE:** 1.0

| Number | Deliverable | Specification |
| -----: | ----------- | ------------- |
| 1a | Cipher Interface Design | Define TypeScript interface with encrypt/decrypt methods accepting Uint8Array |
| 1b | DdcClientOptions Extension | Add optional cipher field to existing options interface |
| 1c | DdcClient Integration | Modify constructor, upload(), and download() methods to handle encryption |
| 1d | AES-GCM Implementation | Create production-ready AES-GCM cipher class |
| 1e | Unit Tests | Comprehensive test suite with mock XOR cipher and integration tests |
| 1f | Documentation | Update SDK documentation with encryption examples |

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Cipher interface properly defined and exported
- Upload/download flows seamlessly handle encryption when cipher provided
- All existing functionality remains unchanged (backward compatibility)
- Unit tests achieve >95% coverage
- Integration tests verify round-trip encryption/decryption

### Milestone 2 — Playground Integration
- **Estimated Duration:** 2 weeks
- **FTE:** 1.0

| Number | Deliverable | Specification |
| -----: | ----------- | ------------- |
| 2a | UI Components | Encryption checkbox, key input field, download & decrypt button |
| 2b | React Integration | Connect UI controls to SDK encryption functionality |
| 2c | User Experience | Intuitive flow for enabling/disabling encryption |
| 2d | Error Handling | Proper error messages for invalid keys or decryption failures |
| 2e | Visual Feedback | Clear indicators when files are encrypted vs plain |

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Encryption can be toggled on/off in Playground UI
- Users can input custom encryption keys
- Encrypted uploads show unintelligible data when downloaded directly
- "Download & Decrypt" successfully retrieves original plaintext
- Error handling provides clear feedback to users

### Milestone 3 — CLI Enhancement
- **Estimated Duration:** 1 weeks
- **FTE:** 1.0

| Number | Deliverable | Specification |
| -----: | ----------- | ------------- |
| 3a | Command Flags | Implement --encrypt and --key flags for upload/download |
| 3b | Argument Parsing | Robust parsing and validation of encryption parameters |
| 3c | CLI Integration | Connect flags to SDK encryption functionality |
| 3d | Help Documentation | Update CLI help text with encryption examples |
| 3e | End-to-End Testing | Verify CLI encryption workflow on testnet |

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- `ddc upload --encrypt --key <hex>` successfully encrypts files
- `ddc download --encrypt --key <hex>` successfully decrypts files
- Invalid keys or missing flags provide helpful error messages
- Help documentation clearly explains encryption usage
- CLI maintains all existing functionality

## Future Plans

**Long-term Maintenance:**
- Establish monitoring for encryption/decryption performance
- Plan for future cryptographic standard updates (post-quantum readiness)
- Consider integration with hardware security modules (HSMs)

**Short-term Enhancement:**
- Gather community feedback on encryption UX
- Optimize performance for large file encryption
- Add support for multiple encryption algorithms
- Create developer tutorials and best practices guide

**Long-term Vision:**
- Contribute to Cere ecosystem as ongoing community member
- Explore advanced features like key derivation and rotation
- Potential collaboration on future Cere infrastructure projects

## Preferred method of funds delivery
- USDC on Ethereum address: [Your 0x address]



## Additional Details

**Technical Approach:**
- Use Web Crypto API for browser compatibility
- Implement secure key handling with proper warnings
- Follow cryptographic best practices (authenticated encryption)
- Ensure consistent behavior across SDK, Playground, and CLI

**Risk Mitigation:**
- Comprehensive testing strategy including edge cases
- Security review of cryptographic implementation
- Performance benchmarking for large files
- Backward compatibility validation
