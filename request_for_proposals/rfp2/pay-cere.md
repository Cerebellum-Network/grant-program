# PayCere - Smart Contract for USDC/USDT to $CERE Swap and Bridge

## Proposal submitted to Cere Foundation on 2025-04-18 by Dai Mian

## Project Slug


## Abstract
PayCere is a smart contract solution designed to automate the process of topping up developer accounts on the Cere Network. Users deposit USDC or USDT into the PayCere contract on an EVM-compatible network. The contract then automatically swaps these stablecoins for $CERE via a DEX like Uniswap, and subsequently bridges the $CERE tokens to the Cere Mainnet using the official Cere bridging tool.

The goal of PayCere is to reduce user friction and simplify the onboarding process by enabling a one-click solution for users to top up their Cere Developer Console balances using familiar stablecoins. It also emits structured events for potential integration with balance-tracking tools or Cere APIs, thus supporting future expansions like account update automations (Bounty 3).
